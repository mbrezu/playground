# STAN

A PL/SQL STatic ANalyzer.

## Rationale

This seems to be missing from the PL/SQL ecosystem. There's a tool
included with Toad For Oracle, but that one is not only commercial,
but also expensive.

Besides, it looks like a nice learning project.

## Prerequisites

 * OUnit (<http://www.xs4all.nl/~mmzeeman/ocaml/>).


This is a project I'm working on with a few goals in mind, all
connected to self education. They are:

1) Learn Haskell

2) Learn about optimizing compilers

3) Apply what I learn to Synpl, which is an older project I've
practically abandoned (http://synpl.blogspot.com)

So don't expect much from this code, especially since I'm working on
it on weekends and (very) early mornings.

The code I write for this project is released under GPL 3, see the
COPYING file.

If you'd like to contact me, use GitHub messages or mbrezu@gmail.com
for email.
